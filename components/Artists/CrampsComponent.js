      lyrics="♫ Well, when the sun goes down and the moon comes up
I turn into a teenage Goo Goo Muck
Yeah, I cruise through the city and I roam the streets
Looking for something that is nice to eat, mmm
You better duck
When I show up
The Goo Goo Muck
I'm the night headhunter looking for some head
With a way-out body underneath that head
Yeah, I'll get you, baby, with a little luck
'Cause I'm a teenage tiger and a Goo Goo Muck
You better duck
When I show up
The Goo Goo Muck
Yeah, the city is a jungle and I'm a beast
I'm a teenage tiger looking for a feast
Yeah, I want the most but I'll take the least
'Cause I'm a Goo Goo Muck tiger and a teenage beast
You better duck
When I show up
The Goo Goo Muck
The Goo Goo Muck

       ♫"
