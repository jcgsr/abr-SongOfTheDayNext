      lyrics="♫ Dance, ooh, stand, ooh
Move to charity ball
Dance, ooh, stand, ooh
Move to charity ball
Get the musicians ready
Get them good and hot
Good and hot, woo
Stand and deliver
Give em everything you've got
You got my number
Charity ball
Ooh, stand, ooh
Move to Charity Ball
Dance, ooh, stand, ooh
Move to charity ball
Come on and grab a partner
We're gonna roll
Till the break of dawn
And I need you
I need you
I need you
Charity Ball
I'm ready
I wanna be there
Yes, I'm ready
I wanna be there
I'm ready
I wanna be there
Charity ball
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
I wanna be there
