      lyrics="♫ I wish I knew how It would feel to be free I wish I could break
      All the chains holding me I wish I could say All the things that I
      should say Say 'em loud say 'em clear For the whole round world to
      hear I wish I could share All the love that's in my heart Remove all
      the bars That keep us apart I wish you could know What it means to
      be me Then you'd see and agree That every man should be free I wish
      I could give All I'm longin' to give I wish I could live Like I'm
      longin' to live I wish I could do All the things that I can do
      Though I'm way overdue I'd be starting anew. Well I wish I could be
      like a bird in the sky How sweet it would be If I found I could fly
      I'd soar to the sun And look down at the sea And I sing 'cause I
      know How it feels to be free ♫"
