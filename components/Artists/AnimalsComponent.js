      lyrics="♫   It's a hard world to get a break in
All the good things have been taken

But girl there are ways
To make certain things pay
Though I'm dressed in these rags
I'll wear sable some day

Hear what I say
I'm going to ride this serpent
No more time spent sweating rent
Hear my command?
I'm breakin' loose, It ain't no use
Holdin' me down
Stickin' around
But baby (baby), remember (remember)

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong, hurt me sometime
But someday I'll treat you real fine

There'll be women and their fortunes
Who'll just want to mother orphans

Are you going to cry
While I'm squeezin' them dry?
Taking all I can get, no regrets
When I

Openly lie
And live on their money
Believe me honey, that money
Can you believe I ain't no saint?
No complaints!
So girl, throw out any doubt
And baby (baby), remember (remember)

It's my life and I'll do what I want
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
Show me I'm wrong
Hurt me sometime
But someday I'll treat you real fine

It's my life and I'll do what I want
(Don't push me)
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
(It's my life)
It's my life and I'll do what I want
(I can do what I want!)
It's my mind and I'll think what I want
(You can't tell me, babe)!
It's my life and I'll do what I want
I'll do what I want! ♫"
