              Listening to this song is like feeling the pain, the anger, the
              longing to be free. Whenever I hear Nina&apos;s voice singing this
              song is like a flood of bitterness that she may have had to
              experience for whatever goddamned reasons. In fact, the reason I
              created this site was to, say, pay an homage to her.
