              Listening to this song is excruciating because this is what I have
              been going through since my mother passed away in 2013. &quot;One
              by one their seats were emptied...&quot; O, boy... My mother
              (February 2013), my father (June 2020), my sister (December 2020),
              and my grandmother (April 2022), only to mention the most recent
              ones... if you go back just a little... O, boy... And then I keep
              asking myself: &quot;Will it be complete one day? Will the circle
              be unbroken...&quot;. It&apos;s almost unbearable sometimes.
